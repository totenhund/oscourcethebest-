A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. 

How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table? 

2^16/2^13 = 8 or 16 - 13 = 3, 2^3 = 8 (2^16 because virtual addresses are 16 bit and 2^13 because page size is 8KB)

We will get 8 pages.
So there are 8 entries are needed in single-level linear page
table.
